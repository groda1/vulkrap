Renderer:
    * vertex_input_assembly VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP, (If you set the primitiveRestartEnable member to VK_TRUE, then it's possible to break up lines and triangles in the _STRIP topology modes by using a special index of 0xFFFF or 0xFFFFFFFF)

    * Proper device picking

    * Dont allocate buffer memory on every vertex/index buffer creation. This could be batched.

    * Setup a usable API for a game

    * Recreating swapchain should possibly recreate uniform buffers as the number of images could change.
    * Include shaders in binary

Window:
    * Handle resize events
    * Measure delta time properly
