Renderer:
    [ ] vertex_input_assembly VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP, (If you set the primitiveRestartEnable member to VK_TRUE, then it's possible to break up lines and triangles in the _STRIP topology modes by using a special index of 0xFFFF or 0xFFFFFFFF)
    [ ] Proper device picking
    [ ] Dont allocate buffer memory on every vertex/index buffer creation. This could be managed by an allocator.
        See memory.rs
    [ ] Setup a usable API for a game structure
    [ ] Recreating swapchain should possibly recreate uniform buffers as the number of images could change.


Game:
    [ ] Setup game structure. Which holds the rendering context and is called from window
    [ ] Include shaders in binary

Window:
    [ ] Handle resize events
    [x] Measure delta time properly
